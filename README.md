# moodle-mod_forumlink
Moodle module that provides a way to add a link to a forum in another section.

At times, you may want students to create new posts in a forum that already exists in another section. For example, you create a forum that appears as an activity in the first section (topic or week). However, you want students to continue to post to this forum in later sections. You can then use this activity to add a link back to the previous forum. 

You could create the same effect by using the url activity. However, if you do, the icon next to the activity will look like a url rather than a forum. This keeps the forum icon while also making the link easier to create.
